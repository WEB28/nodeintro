`npm init y` => generates a new package.json file

`npm i express` => install <npm package>

`npm i` => download all dependencies, similar to using `yarn` in a React project

`npx gitignore node` => generates a `.gitignore` file for node (make sure to use `npx`, because it runs as an npm package from the terminal without installing it globally)
